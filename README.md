# My zshrc
I have this repo for my own convenience. It contains only my .zshrc file so that I can keep my Terminal windows in sync accross my devices.

## oh-my-zsh
This .zshrc file is taken from the Oh-my-zsh project found [here](http://ohmyz.sh/).

## jilles.me blogpost
This ( http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/ ) blogpost helped me setup my current system

## How to implement
Create a symlink in your home directory to this .zshrc file:
```bash
$ cd ~
$ ln -s /path/to/this/repo/.zshrc
```
